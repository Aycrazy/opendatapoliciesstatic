This directory contains scripts that generally only served a one-time purpose. But hey, why not keep them here and include them as part of our open-source record?

- `sdxml2md.py` was used to transfer content from our [old repo](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/opendatapoliciesdecoded/tree/master/htdocs/admin/import-data) to the new static site, back when this static site was new.
- `generate_state_pages.py` was used to generate all the state pages given a list of states.
- `generate_place_pages.py` was used to extract place information from the documents to create the place pages.
- `generate_new_docs.py` was used to edit the metadata of the documents to get it into the format that we wanted.
