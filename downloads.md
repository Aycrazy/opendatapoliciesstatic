## If you are familiar with how to use GitHub

You can find the repository that powers this site [here](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/opendatapoliciesstatic). If you fork the repository and then clone it onto your computer, you will have a copy of all the open-data policies. They are located in the *_documents* directory.

## If you are not familiar with GitHub

Not to worry! It's as easy as 1-2-3.

1. Go to [this page](https://github.com/sunlightpolicy/opendatapoliciesstatic) and click the green *Clone or download* button in the upper-right corner.
2. Click *Download ZIP*. Your browser should download a zip file.
3. Unzip the file, open it up, and find the *_documents* folder. This contains all the policies.
